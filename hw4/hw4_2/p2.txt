// Write your answer to Problem 2 (b) and (c) here

Program 1 uses a for loop to increment a counter 15 times. If branch prediction isn't used, the program would have to wait 5 cycles each loop 
leading to 75 unused cycles. 15 is used because a larger value isn't needed to show that the delay would linearly increase with 
each loop cycle. 

Program 2 uses nested If statements to test branch prediction cases. Overall there are 4 times the branch should be taken, and 1 where it shouldn't. We test the depth of the nested if statements, and then proceed to test a case where predicting not-taken is faster, and a case where predict not-taken is slower/ could break a malfunctioning processor (by introducing a RAW hazard during the branch not taken)
