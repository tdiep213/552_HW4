// Write your answer to Problem 1 (b) here
All programs test forwarding by assigning the register the instruction before the jump. 

Program 1 tests both the jump feature and link features of JALR. It tests the link feature by storing the linked value then 
referencing it against a known value. It tests only part of the jump feature by jumping past one instruction relative to itself.

Program 2 tests the immediate arithmetic operation works properally by jumping a set number of instructions that are a known address value away. 

Program 3 tests both the jump and exeption handling by having the jump target an out-of-bounds address.
